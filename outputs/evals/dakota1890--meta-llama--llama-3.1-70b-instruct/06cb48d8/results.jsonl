The dictionary provides the following examples:\n\n* u\u014b (near the speaker)\n* ku\u014b (near the person addressed)\n* yu\u014b (at a distance from both speaker and person addressed)\n* he (in sight, but not near)\n* ka (out of sight, but not far)\n\nThese demonstrative words are used to indicate the location of a noun, and are often used in combination with other words to provide more specific information about the noun's position. For example:\n\n* u\u014b-wi\u014b (this, near the speaker)\n* ku\u014b-wi\u014b (that, near the person addressed)\n\nIn Dakota, the demonstrative pattern is an important part of the language, as it helps to clarify the relationship between the speaker, the listener, and the noun being referred to.","role":"assistant"}],"task":"default","reward":0.1078313253,"generation_ms":4393.9030170441,"scoring_ms":1.0035037994,"total_ms":4394.9065208435,"info":{"difficulty":"medium","hints":[],"required_affixes":[],"rule_id":null,"special_chars":[],"task_type":"default","verification_pattern":null},"answer":"demonstrative","exact_match_reward":0.0,"char_overlap_reward":0.0313253012,"pattern_reward":0.0,"affix_reward":1.0}
