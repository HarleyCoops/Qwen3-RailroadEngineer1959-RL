Specifically, it follows the pattern of \"wa\u014b-verbs\" or \"wa\u014b-locatives\", which indicate the location or position of a noun relative to the speaker.\n\nIn the 1890 Dakota-English Dictionary, this pattern is described as \"words that point out the place where a thing is\" (Riggs 1890: 13).\n\nExamples:\n\n* wa\u014b- (proximal, near the speaker) - e.g., wa\u014b \u0160\u00fa\u014b (this dog)\n* he- (medial, at a distance from the speaker) - e.g., he \u0160\u00fa\u014b (that dog, at a distance)\n* ka- (distal, far from the speaker) - e.g., ka \u0160\u00fa\u014b (that dog, far away)\n\nThis grammatical pattern is important in Dakota, as it helps to establish the relationship between the speaker, the listener, and the noun being referred to.","role":"assistant"}],"task":"default","reward":0.1100619195,"generation_ms":4674.6599674225,"scoring_ms":0.9999275208,"total_ms":4675.6598949432,"info":{"difficulty":"medium","hints":[],"required_affixes":[],"rule_id":null,"special_chars":[],"task_type":"default","verification_pattern":null},"answer":"demonstrative","exact_match_reward":0.0,"char_overlap_reward":0.040247678,"pattern_reward":0.0,"affix_reward":1.0}
