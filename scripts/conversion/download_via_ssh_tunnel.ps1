# Alternative download method using SSH tunnel
# This works if you're already connected via SSH

# Step 1: First, create the archive on the remote server
# Run this in your SSH session:
#   cd ~/dakota_rl_training/outputs/ledger_test_400/weights
#   tar -czf ~/model_step_400.tar.gz step_400/

# Step 2: Then download from PowerShell (new window)
# You'll need the public IP from Prime Intellect dashboard
