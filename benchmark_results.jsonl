What part of speech is this word, and what is its relationship to 'hutkaŋ'?", "expected_answer": "You would use `a-hu'-tkan-yan` to describe something 'branching, having many prongs or roots'. This is an adverb, describing how something branches. It is related to `hutkaŋ`, which refers to the root or base of a tree.", "model_response": "ERROR: Generation failed: (ReadTimeoutError(\"HTTPSConnectionPool(host='sodh94mt9pt8xuzf.us-east4.gcp.endpoints.huggingface.cloud', port=443): Read timed out.

If `a-mna'-ći-ći-ya` means 'to gather for oneself' or 'to be selfish,' what specific meaning does `amnawećiya` likely convey?", "expected_answer": "Given that `amnawećiya` is an inflected form of the reflexive verb `a-mna'-ći-ći-ya` ('to gather for oneself,' 'to be selfish'), and considering common Dakota inflection patterns, `amnawećiya` likely indicates the first-person singular.
