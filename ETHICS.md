# Ethics & Community Collaboration

- Engage Dakota language experts and communities in evaluation and goal-setting.
- Prefer community-reviewed glosses; annotate uncertainty explicitly.
- Avoid cultural essentialism; document known limitations of 1890s sources.
- Accept removal/annotation requests from community members.
