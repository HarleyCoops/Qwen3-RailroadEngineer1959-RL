How do their meanings evolve from one to the next?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "`a-gu'` is a participle meaning 'burnt on,' describing a state. `a-gu'-gu` is a neuter verb, derived from `agu` through reduplication, meaning 'to burn on any thing' or 'to burn on account of.' `a-gu'-gu-ya` is an active verb, a causative form (likely of `aguya`, a derivation of `agu`), meaning 'to cause to burn on.' The reduplication in `a-gu'-gu` often suggests a continuous or repeated action, or an action happening for a reason, while the `-ya` suffix indicates causing the action."}]}
