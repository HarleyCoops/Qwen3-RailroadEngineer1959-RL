# Enhanced Synthetic Q&A Generation for Dakota Dictionary

## Overview

The Dakota dictionary extraction produces much richer linguistic data than simple word-definition pairs. This document outlines how to leverage this richness for sophisticated bidirectional Q&A generation.

## Rich Dictionary Structure

Each extracted entry contains:

```json
{
  "headword": "a-na'-hdo-ka",
  "definition_primary": "to wear a hole in, as in a moccasin, on something",
  "definition_secondary": "additional meanings if present",
  "part_of_speech": "v. a.",
  "pos_full": "verb active",
  "derived_from": "nahdoka",
  "root_meaning": "meaning of root word",
  "inflected_forms": ["anawahdoka", "uŋkćakapį"],
  "grammatical_notes": "detailed grammatical explanations",
  "usage_notes": "contextual usage information",
  "example_phrases": ["example sentences"],
  "see_also": ["related_words"],
  "compare_with": ["similar_words"]
}
```

## Enhanced Q&A Types

- "What happens when you add 'a' to a verb in Dakota?"
- "Explain the morphological structure of a-na'-hdo-ka."

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhance Entry Context
- Include `part_of_speech`, `inflected_forms`, `derived_from`, `grammatical_notes` in prompts
- Group entries by related words (using `see_also` and `compare_with`)
- Identify polysemous words (same headword, different POS/meanings)

### Phase 2: Diversified Question Generation
- Generate 10+ question types per entry batch
- Weight question types based on entry richness:
  - Basic entries: Translation questions
  - Rich entries: Etymology, inflections, grammatical usage
  - Cross-referenced entries: Comparative questions

### Phase 3: Context-Aware Answers
- Include grammatical notes in answers
- Reference inflected forms when relevant
- Explain word formation patterns
- Connect to related words

### Phase 4: Bidirectional Sophistication
- **English → Dakota**: Not just "word for X" but "How do you express X concept grammatically?"
- **Dakota → English**: Not just "what does Y mean" but "How is Y used? What are its forms?"

## Benefits

1. **Grammar Integration**: Connects dictionary to grammar rules (RL training)
2. **Morphological Understanding**: Teaches word formation patterns
3. **Semantic Depth**: Explores meanings beyond simple translation
4. **Cultural Context**: Preserves cultural concepts embedded in language
5. **Linguistic Accuracy**: Maintains precision with special characters and grammatical detail

## Example Enhanced Q&A Pairs

```json
{
  "question": "What is the Dakota verb for 'to hide' and how is it conjugated?",
  "answer": "The Dakota verb for 'to hide' is a-na'-hma (v. a.). Its inflected forms include anawahbe, anayahbe, and anaunhmanpi. This verb comes from the root word and can be used with various prefixes to express different aspects of hiding.",
  "question_type": "translation_with_grammar",
  "source_language": "english",
  "entry_ids": ["page_095_entry_002"]
}
```

```json
{
  "question": "How is the prefix 'a' used grammatically in Dakota, and what does it change when added to verbs?",
  "answer": "The prefix 'a' in Dakota serves multiple grammatical functions: 1) As an inseparable preposition/prefix meaning 'on' or 'upon' when prefixed to verbs and adjectives; 2) It can give a causative meaning to verbs; 3) It forms collective plurals with some motion verbs; 4) Prefixed to nouns, it creates adverbs; 5) It can make nouns from verbs. For example, 'a-na'-hdo-ka' (to wear a hole) is derived from 'nahdoka' with the 'a' prefix.",

}
```

```json
{
  "question": "What are all the different meanings of 'a' in Dakota?",
